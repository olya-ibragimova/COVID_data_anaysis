This is a notebook with a code I created for Hack The North 2020++ project.
The final output in this code consists of total population and COVID data in the past 30 days in the city of interest as well as risk assessment of getting COVID.
The updated dataset can be found at https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/confirmed-positive-cases-of-covid-19-in-ontario/resource/455fd63b-603d-4608-8216-7d8647f43350
